# Marvel Comic Store
Live View: https://comic-store-nn.herokuapp.com/

This project was inspired by a challenge of [Contabilizei](https://github.com/contabilizei/front-end-teste).
Use Marvel's Comic API: [**developer.marvel.com/**](https://developer.marvel.com/). In addition, it generates 10% of the Comics as 'rare' item, defined by the top thick border.
In the 'My Cart' page you can apply discount coupons. There are two types, for regular comic and for rare item.
Try this: **5D3KtyEK** or **XT4696b**
